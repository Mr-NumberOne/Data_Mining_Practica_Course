### Skewness:

Skewness measures the asymmetry of the distribution of data values. It indicates whether the data is skewed to the left (negative skewness), skewed to the right (positive skewness), or symmetrically distributed (zero skewness). Skewness helps identify the presence of outliers and the shape of the distribution.

### Variance:

Variance measures the spread or dispersion of data points around the mean. It quantifies the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean. A higher variance indicates a wider distribution and greater variability in the data, while a lower variance suggests a more concentrated distribution.

### Standard Deviation:

Standard deviation is a measure of the dispersion of data points relative to the mean. It quantifies the average distance between each data point and the mean. A higher standard deviation indicates a greater spread and variability in the data, while a lower standard deviation suggests that the data points are closer to the mean.
